##Sublime Text key bindings for PyCharm

I'm manually swapping out PyCharm keymap to be more like Sublime's.

It's based on the "Mac OS X 10.5+" keymap in PyCharm and has only been tested on OS X.


###Installation

Copy the xml file into your keymaps directory.

**Windows and *NIX systems:** <User home>/.PyCharm <xx>/config/keymaps

**Macintosh systems:** ~/Library/Preferences/PyCharm40/keymaps
